-------------
## `useReducer`
- [Type checking](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/extra/src/final/TS/01.extra-3.tsx) using `typeof` keyword to support an `action` in function and object form
- Classic Redux `dispatch` approach to `useReducer()`

## `useCallback` - custom hooks
- [Discriminated union](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html#discriminated-unions) for typing a promise's responses (note: [this won't work (line 94)](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/extra/src/final/TS/02.tsx) for destructured `state` properties)
- Avoiding *race condition* by [type checking](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/extra/src/final/TS/02.tsx) the state's promise vs the action's promise
- Abort unused requests [(at line 122)](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/extra/src/final/TS/02.tsx) by using the `new AbortController()` interface
- Preventing memory leak by [cleaning up](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/master/src/exercise/02.js) the `ref` (example at the `useSafeDispatch` definition)
- [Dependency array](https://epicreact.dev/modules/advanced-react-hooks/usecallback-custom-hooks-solution) @3:00
- Spreading state object (in the custom hook defintion) and then destructuring it when we use that custom hook ([Extra Credit 2 at `useAsync()` hook](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/master/src/exercise/02.js))

## `useContext`
- Basic implementation of `context` API
- [Sometimes](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/extra/src/final/TS/03.tsx) you donâ€™t need context. The biggest use case for context is for libraries that need to implicitly share state between components (i.e. *compound component*).

## `useLayoutEffect`
- `useLayoutEffect()` is invoked AFTER the render (DOM mutations) but BEFORE the browser paints the change. Use it if you need to mutate the DOM (making observable changes to the DOM) and/or do need to perform measurements that are essential to the browser paint (the appearance or placement of the UI elements on the screen). [Example](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/extra/src/final/TS/04.tsx)

## `useImperativeHandle`
- Assigning custom methods to `ref.current` by using [`useImperativeHandle`](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-hooks/blob/extra/src/final/TS/05.tsx) hook

## `useDebugValue`    
- `useDebugValue` can **only** be called inside of a custom hook and is used to label custom hooks so you can easily identify them in the React DevTools
